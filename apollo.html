        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 - August 25, 2012) was 
an American astronaut and aerospace engineer. He is best known as the 
first person to walk on the Moon during NASA's Apollo 11 mission in 
1969. Armstrong's historic step onto the lunar surface marked a 
significant achievement in human history.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Interesting Fact</h3>
        <p>Apollo celebrated his birthday on Earth inside his capsule 
with his colleagues due to the possibility of contamination from the 
Moon before emerging in public.</p>

        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>Neil Armstrong married Janet Shearon in 1956, and they had 
three children: Eric, Karen, and Mark. His family provided him with 
support and encouragement throughout his career, and he often credited 
them for their role in his success.</p>

        <h3>Life Sacrifices</h3>
        <p>Armstrong's journey to the Moon was not without sacrifices 
and risks. He and other astronauts underwent extensive training and 
faced the dangers of space exploration. On January 27, 1967, a tragedy 
occurred when a fire in the cabin during a pre-launch test claimed the 
lives of his Apollo 1 crewmates, Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. 
Chaffee. Armstrong and others continued their mission, knowing the 
risks, and ultimately achieved their goal of landing on the lunar 
surface.</p>

        <h3>Moon Landing Moment</h3>
        <p>On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong descended from the lunar 
module's ladder and became the first man to walk on the Moon. His famous
 words, </p><p id="p">"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,"</p>
 were heard by millions on Earth. This historic moment symbolized the 
boundless possibilities of human exploration and inspired generations to
 come.<p></p>
